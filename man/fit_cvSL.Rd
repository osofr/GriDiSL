\usage{
fit_cvSL(ID, t_name, x, y, data, params, nfolds = 5, fold_column = NULL,
  seed = NULL, verbose = getOption("longDiSL.verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{A character string name of the column that contains the unique subject identifiers.}

\item{t_name}{A character string name of the column with integer-valued measurement time-points (in days, weeks, months, etc).}

\item{x}{A vector containing the names of predictor variables to use for modeling. If x is missing, then all columns except \code{ID}, \code{y} are used.}

\item{y}{A character string name of the column that represent the response variable in the model.}

\item{data}{Input dataset, can be a \code{data.frame} or a \code{data.table}.}

\item{params}{Parameters specifying the type of modeling procedure to be used.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds to use in cross-validation.}

\item{fold_column}{The name of the column in the input data that contains the cross-validation fold indicators (must be an ordered factor).}

\item{seed}{Random number seed for selecting a random holdout.}

\item{verbose}{Set to \code{TRUE} to print messages on status and information to the console. Turn this on by default using \code{options(longDiSL.verbose=TRUE)}.}

\item{expr_to_train}{Additional logical expression which will further subset observations (rows) for training data.
Use this to restrict the model fitting to a specific subsample of the training dataset.}

\description{
Define and fit discrete SuperLearner for growth curve modeling.
Model selection (scoring) is based on V-fold cross-validated MSE that leaves entire subjects outside of the training sample.
This is in contrast to holdout SuperLearner in \code{\link{fit_holdoutSL}} that leaves only a single random (or last) growth measurement  outside of the training sample.
