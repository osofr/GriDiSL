\item{ID}{A character string name of the column that contains the unique subject identifiers.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of unique folds (same fold is always assigned to all observations that share the same ID).}

\item{fold_column}{A name of the column that will contain the fold indicators}

\item{seed}{Random number seed for selecting a random fold.}
}
\value{
An input data with added fold indicator column (as ordered factor with levels 1:nfolds).
